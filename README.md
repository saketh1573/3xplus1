# Collatz Conjecture Solver

This Python program calculates the number of steps it takes for a given positive integer to reach the value 1 using the Collatz conjecture (3x+1 problem).

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3x+1 problem, is an unsolved mathematical problem. It starts with a positive integer `n` and repeatedly applies the following rules until `n` becomes 1:

1. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
2. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The conjecture states that, for any positive integer `n`, this process will eventually reach the value 1, no matter what value of `n` you start with. Despite its simplicity, this conjecture remains unproven and is a fascinating problem in number theory.
